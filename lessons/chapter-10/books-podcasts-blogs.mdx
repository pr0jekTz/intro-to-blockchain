While Web3 info is often online, some books and media give depth:

- **Books:**
  - _“Mastering Bitcoin”_ by Andreas M. Antonopoulos – great technical but accessible dive into Bitcoin.

  - _“Mastering Ethereum”_ by Antonopoulos and Gavin Wood – though a bit dated (2018), still solid on Ethereum mechanics and Solidity basics.

  - _“The Infinite Machine”_ by Camila Russo – narrative of Ethereum’s founding (for historical context).

  - _“Cryptocurrency and Blockchain: An Introduction”_ by Antony Lewis – good beginner-friendly guide covering many aspects.

  - _“Token Economy”_ by Shermin Voshmgir – explores the concept of tokens and their roles.

  - **For more economic angle:** _“The Bitcoin Standard”_ by Saifedean Ammous – advocates Bitcoin as sound money (controversial in parts but important perspective).

  - For developer deep-dives: _“Building Ethereum DApps”_ by Roberto Infante – practical coding book.

  - As we mentioned, Chris Dixon’s _“Read Write Own”_ book (2024) might be worth reading for a broad vision.

- **Podcasts:**
  - _“Unchained”_ by Laura Shin – she interviews major figures weekly. Good way to hear latest projects, plus she doesn’t shy from tough questions (she covered big hacks and controversies too).

  - _“Bankless”_ – focuses on Ethereum/DeFi/metaverse; the hosts discuss weekly news and big picture concepts for going “bankless” (living on crypto).

  - _“The Pomp Podcast”_ (Anthony Pompliano) – he gives more Bitcoin and macro perspective.

  - _“When Shift Happens”_ (Kevin Follonier) \- he helps bring education to the space by sitting down with some of the biggest builders and investors in the industry.

  - _“Epicenter”_ – long-running show with technical interviews of protocol developers.

  - _“Blockchain & Booze”_ – a more casual community podcast with Q\&A.

  - _“The Defiant”_ (also a newsletter by Camila Russo) – focuses on DeFi trends.

  - _“Zima Red”_ – about NFTs and metaverse topics.

- **Blogs/Newsletters:**
  - _CoinDesk_ and _CoinTelegraph_ – industry news sites (good for daily news, though sometimes too hypey; still, they cover major developments and regulatory news).

  - _The Defiant_ newsletter – daily DeFi news and explainers.

  - _Week in Ethereum News_ by Evan Van Ness – weekly technical news on Ethereum ecosystem (for dev updates).

  - _Bankless newsletter_ – has analysis on current market and how-to guides for DeFi.

  - _Messari_ blog and reports – deep dives into various crypto sectors, more research-oriented.

  - _Github and Medium_: Many dev teams post updates on Medium or their own site – worth following projects you like directly (e.g., Uniswap blog, Ethereum Foundation blog which has updates on ETH2 progress, etc.).

  - _r/cryptocurrency_ and _r/ethereum_ on Reddit – discussion forums that often surface news and community opinions (just discern shilling vs quality).
