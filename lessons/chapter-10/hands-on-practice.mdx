To really solidify learning, nothing beats actually using and building:

- **Participate in Web3 tasks:** Try out a DeFi app with a small amount (lend $20 in Aave, swap on Uniswap). Or get a small amount of a stablecoin and practice moving between wallet and an exchange. This helps demystify the processes.

- **Contribute to a DAO or Open Source Project:** Many DAOs welcome newcomers. For example, if you like writing, Bankless DAO has writers; if you design, maybe a metaverse DAO could use help. This gives real experience and sometimes tokens/ pay.

- **Build a simple dApp:** For instance, a to-do list on Ethereum (many tutorials exist). Or build an NFT minting site for fun (perhaps mint NFTs for your study group).

- **Online hackathons:** As mentioned, ETHGlobal hackathons (e.g., ETHAmsterdam, ETHIndia etc.) are open to all time zones now due to virtual format. Even if you’re a beginner, teams often need people for design or presentation or basic web dev – you can join and learn from others. Plus workshops during hackathon week teach new skills (Solidity, using particular protocols' APIs, etc.). And there’s mentorship – experts to help debug or suggest solutions.

- **Capture the Flag (CTF) / Security games:** If you like security, Ethernaut by OpenZeppelin is a war game where each level is a vulnerable contract you must exploit to advance – teaches security pitfalls in Solidity. Damn Vulnerable DeFi is another set of challenges for DeFi hack scenarios. These are fun ways to learn by hacking in a legal sandbox.

- **Testnets:** Use public test networks (Ropsten, Goerli for Ethereum or testnets on other chains) to deploy contracts without real money. Many dev tools have tutorials deploying to testnet. You can simulate being a dApp user or builder safely.

- **StackOverflow/StackExchange:** Keep an eye on questions – try to answer some beginner ones (even doing research to answer will teach you).

- **Local Communities:** If possible, attend a local blockchain meetup or campus blockchain club (if your school doesn’t have one, maybe start one using resources from groups like Blockchain Education Network which supports student clubs). Teaching others is a great way to cement your own knowledge, and you might find mentors or team members for projects.
