- **Ethereum documentation and resources** – ethereum.org/learn
- **Bitcoin Developer Guides** – bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide
- **Solidity Docs** – docs.soliditylang.org (with a list of security best practices).
- **Web3.js Docs** (the JS library to interact with Ethereum) – web3js.readthedocs.io
- **Truffle and Hardhat** – popular dev frameworks with extensive tutorials on their sites.
- **Media**: Good YouTube channels for explainers include Andreas Antonopoulos’s channel (deep dives) and WhiteboardCrypto (simpler visual explainers), also Coin Bureau (covers lots of projects in detail).
- **Safety info**: Websites like rugdoc.io or defiyield shield list known scams and risky projects – check those if you are unsure about a DeFi app. The Ledger Academy glossary (like the Ledger.com site has an Academy with definitions and tips, as glimpsed in Ledger’s composability entry).
- **Community help**: e.g., Discord channels like EthStaker (for learning about staking ETH safely), or developer discords for coding help.

By tapping into these resources and continuing to experiment, you’ll deepen your expertise. Web3 isn’t something you learn once – it’s more like a journey where you keep exploring new blocks (pun intended). But that’s part of what makes it exciting: there’s a chance for young, motivated people to become experts quickly in a fresh field and even help shape it.

So, as you move forward, remember the core principles we covered – decentralization, ownership, transparency – and carry them as guiding lights. And remember to share your knowledge too; in the Web3 spirit, we all lift each other up by open-sourcing, educating, and collaborating. Good luck on your journey in the blockchain world – who knows, you might even build the next big Web3 innovation that we’ll be reading about in future textbooks\!
