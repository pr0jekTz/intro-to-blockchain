The **metaverse** is a buzzword referring to immersive virtual worlds or the next iteration of the internet where people interact in 3D spaces (like VR/AR) and carry out much of social and economic life in digital form. Think of it as a persistent virtual universe blending games, social networks, work environments, shopping, etc.

A notable milestone in the rise of the metaverse was **Facebook's rebranding to Meta in 2021**, signaling the company’s commitment to building “the next chapter of the internet.” Meta also released the **Facebook Portal** and later invested heavily into VR headsets like the Quest series to support social interaction, gaming, and remote work inside immersive digital environments. While the rebrand was met with skepticism, it helped propel the idea of the metaverse into the public imagination.

### **🌀 Sidebar: _Metaverse ≠ Just VR_**

The metaverse isn’t just virtual reality—it’s a persistent, immersive digital layer that merges gaming, identity, finance, and community. Web3 powers ownership in the metaverse: you can own your avatar, land, gear, and even run the world’s economy.

Web3 is seen as a crucial element to building a metaverse that’s **open and user-centric**. Without Web3, a metaverse could easily become a dystopian scenario dominated by a few Big Tech companies owning all the virtual property, identities, and economies (imagine a Facebook/Meta-run metaverse where all transactions are under their surveillance and control, like how they control social media content today). Web3 offers tools to avoid that:

- **Digital Ownership:** NFTs can represent virtual land, avatars, items, and you truly own them. In an open metaverse, you could buy a piece of land in Decentraland and if that world shuts down, maybe port it to another world (or at least the NFT is still yours to trade/sell). If a game closes but your character and gear are NFTs, you still have them in your wallet – maybe a community could even resurrect a version of the game or use those assets elsewhere.

- **Interoperability:** For a metaverse to not be siloed (like how today Fortnite skins are stuck in Fortnite), standards are needed so assets can move between worlds. Web3's open standards for tokens and files can encourage that. E.g., an avatar NFT might adhere to a certain 3D model standard that multiple virtual worlds agree to support (there are efforts like that under groups like the Metaverse Standards Forum). As said, a Web3 asset carries its metadata (often a link to the model, etc.) and ownership rights, so any platform can integrate it if they choose. If enough do, users begin to expect cross-platform identity and inventory.

- **Decentralized Infrastructure:** The metaverse will require huge amounts of data streaming (3D content, social presence). Decentralized networks like IPFS, Livepeer (for streaming), and networks of edge computing (perhaps even Helium’s 5G nodes) can collectively host the metaverse rather than everything on a corporate server farm. This is heavy to do purely P2P, but maybe hybrid models will evolve (like company-run shards but connected via blockchain for overall state, etc).

- **Economic Layer:** The metaverse will have its economy – people buying virtual goods, earning in virtual jobs, etc. Web3 provides a global, always-on, and user-controlled currency system (cryptocurrency) suited for that. Already, games with their own token economies use crypto such as SAND for Sandbox or MANA for Decentraland. One can easily integrate with DeFi (like a player could put their earned tokens in a yield farm when not using them). Also, with crypto wallets, anyone in any country can participate in metaverse economies without needing a bank or facing currency conversion friction. Virtual work (like designing virtual clothes, hosting experiences) can be paid in crypto easily. This lowers barriers for a truly global metaverse workforce.

- **Governance by Users:** If a metaverse world is run by a DAO, users can have a say in policies – for example, Decentraland has DAO votes on things like marketplace fees, content moderation rules, etc. Instead of a corporate overlord, the community shapes the world. This is complex (coordinating thousands of stakeholders isn’t simple), but it’s a step toward a more democratic virtual society.

We already see corporate interest (Meta pivoting to focus on the VR world, others like Microsoft and Epic investing in metaverse tech). Web3 folks are thus pushing the term **“Open Metaverse”** – basically a metaverse akin to Web1’s openness vs the closed “walled gardens” approach. Many NFT and blockchain projects label themselves building blocks of this open metaverse (like selling interoperable avatar NFTs, or building open VR meeting spaces where you connect with Ethereum wallet instead of an email login).

The interplay with VR/AR: Web3 can provide consistent identity and ownership across AR experiences too. For instance, if you have AR glasses, you might “own” the digital graffiti on your house via an NFT – so if someone wants to place AR content on your property visible to others, maybe they’d need your permission or pay rent via a smart contract tied to that NFT. (This is speculative but shows how real-world meets virtual property might use Web3 property rights to avoid AR becoming a spam chaos).

**Metaverse and economy example:** In an open metaverse scenario, a fashion designer could create a line of virtual dresses, mint each design as NFTs, and they’d be usable on avatars in any supporting world (the NFT might include different model files for different platforms’ requirements). They sell them on a blockchain marketplace – people globally buy, their avatars wear them in multiple games or social hubs. The designer automatically gets royalties if the NFT resells. Maybe the NFT also grants the physical version in real life by linking to a service (so phygital goods). All mediated by smart contracts, no centralized platform needed to approve it. The buyer truly owns that item and can lend it or display it in a VR museum etc.

**Social and culture:** Metaverse with Web3 might mean your social connections are portable (like a Farcaster but in 3D spaces – you go to any world and your friends list is accessible because it's on a blockchain social graph). It can also ensure credit and provenance for user-generated content – e.g., if you build an amazing VR room and it gets copied, the original NFT shows you as creator, ensuring you get recognition or even profit share.

However, bridging physical law & order to a decentralized virtual realm is tough – e.g., moderation: if a fully open world allows anything, you can get harassment or content not suitable for some. DAOs might need to implement moderation via community guidelines, and technical tools might allow filtering (like you choose not to see certain flagged content by toggling settings that community-set tags on content – similar to how some forums self-moderate via upvote/downvote or user-applied tags).

**Current examples**:

- **Decentraland** and **The Sandbox** as mentioned are running with user-owned land, building experiences, and community events. They are still relatively small communities (a few thousand active maybe) but they pioneered the model of NFT land and DAO governance.

- **Cryptovoxels (Voxels)** – another user-built virtual world with NFT parcels, quite popular for crypto art galleries.

- Big brands doing Web3 experiments: e.g., Nike acquired RTFKT (a studio making NFT sneakers and artifacts) – possibly planning to sell virtual Nike gear that’s NFT-based and cross-platform.

- On the collaboration front: The “Metaverse Standards Forum” includes players like Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and also Web3 orgs like the Web3D consortium, to try ensure some compatibility – though whether they include NFT standards remains to be seen; at least they acknowledge the need for open standards.

In summary, Web3 ensures the metaverse isn't just a rehash of today's tech monopolies on steroids. It aspires to give users **ownership of digital assets and influence** in digital spaces, making the metaverse a place where value accrues to creators and participants, not just platform owners. As the line between digital and physical blurs, Web3 principles could maintain human agency and rights in virtual environments.
