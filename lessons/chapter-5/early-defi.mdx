The roots of DeFi can be traced back to the launch of **Ethereum** in 2015\. Ethereum’s smart contract capability allowed developers to program complex financial logic onchain, which Bitcoin’s more limited scripting couldn’t easily do. One of the first building blocks was the concept of a **decentralized exchange (DEX)**. Early DEX attempts, like EtherDelta (2017), showed you could trade tokens peer-to-peer using smart contracts, though it was clunky.

**🧠 DEFINING DEFI**

DeFi \= Financial services powered by code, not institutions.  
Instead of a bank ledger, you have blockchain. Instead of bank policies, you have smart contracts. Instead of paperwork, you just use your wallet.

A huge milestone was the creation of **MakerDAO** in 2017\. MakerDAO introduced the first major decentralized stablecoin, **DAI**. Stablecoins are tokens pegged to stable assets (like USD). MakerDAO allows users to lock collateral (initially ETH) in a smart contract and generate DAI as a loan against that collateral. This was like a decentralized bank issuing a loan, with code ensuring the loan is over-collateralized (so the system stays solvent). DAI maintained its $1 value through a system of smart contracts and community governance. This concept of borrowing and stablecoins laid the foundation for DeFi lending markets and stable digital money that’s not controlled by a central entity (unlike Tether or USDC which are issued by companies). MakerDAO proved a decentralized credit system could work.

Around the same time and into 2018, other components emerged:

- **Decentralized exchanges** improved with protocols like **Uniswap** (launched November 2018). Uniswap introduced an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model where liquidity providers pool tokens, and traders swap against the pool using a formula for pricing. This removed the need for order books and made exchanges fully onchain and automated. Uniswap was simple but powerful—it allowed _anyone_ to become a market maker (earn fees) and trade directly from their wallet, controlling their funds the whole time.

- **Lending platforms** like **Compound** (2018) and **Aave** (2019) came, enabling people to earn interest by lending crypto to a pool and others to borrow from that pool by providing collateral. These are akin to savings & loan services, but running on smart contracts.

### **🔍 TECH DEEP DIVE: The AMM Revolution**

Before AMMs like Uniswap, DEXs relied on order books like traditional exchanges. AMMs replaced that with a simple formula (e.g., x \* y \= k), creating **liquidity pools** where anyone can provide assets and earn fees—no need for professional market makers.

These pieces—stablecoins (for stable value), DEXs (for trading), and lending protocols—created a base financial system on Ethereum. Yet, in early days, usage was relatively small—crypto itself was niche, and DeFi had maybe a few hundred million dollars in total locked value by early 2019\.

**2019-2020 – The Dawn of “DeFi” as a movement:** By 2019, people started referring to this suite of applications as “DeFi” and projects began to integrate. For instance, you could deposit DAI into Compound to earn interest, or trade tokens from Maker’s vaults on Uniswap. This composability (money legos) was a key innovation: because all protocols were open and on Ethereum, they could seamlessly work together.

A big turning point was **“DeFi Summer” of 2020**. In mid-2020, Compound launched its **COMP governance token** and began distributing it to users (“yield farming”) as a reward for using the platform. This sparked a frenzy—suddenly using DeFi platforms could earn you lucrative tokens on top of normal interest or fees. Many projects followed with their own liquidity mining programs. Users piled into DeFi protocols to earn yields, pushing the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi from around $1 billion at the start of 2020 to nearly $10+ billion by late 2020\. This explosive growth period earned the nickname DeFi Summer. It also saw an explosion of innovation and some craziness (some unaudited or meme protocols launching with food-themed names, etc., not all of which ended well).

By late 2020:

- **Uniswap** was facilitating billions in cumulative trading volume, rivaling some centralized exchanges on certain days.

- **Compound and Aave** had unlocked the concept of _flash loans_—loans that you could take out and repay within one transaction (useful for arbitrage or moving collateral without own capital).

- People created **yield aggregators** like Yearn Finance to hop between best yields automatically.

- **Synthetix** offered synthetic assets tracking things like gold or stocks via crypto collateral.

- **Insurance** protocols (Nexus Mutual, etc.) started to offer coverage for DeFi smart contract risks—itself a DeFi product.

  DeFi’s past can’t be mentioned without the occasional mishaps: There were hacks and bugs—e.g., the DAO hack (2016) before DeFi officially but a lesson for all, the Parity multisig bug (2017), and later on some DeFi projects in 2020 had exploits (like bZx hack, etc.). These underscored the experimental, risky nature. But each incident also led to learning and improved practices (audit culture, formal verification, etc.).

  To summarize the early timeline:

- **2015-2016:** Ethereum live, concepts of decentralized trading and DAOs tried (one big failure with The DAO, which ironically slowed decentralized fund management until later).

- **2017:** MakerDAO and DAI stablecoin launched—first decentralized stablecoin. EtherDelta shows DEX concept.

- **2018:** Uniswap, Compound launch—core DeFi primitives (trading AMM and lending pool). Also, the term “DeFi” starts to be used among crypto communities.

- **2019:** DeFi grows quietly, integrated with stablecoins (USDC launched 2018, etc.), WBTC (wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum) launched in 2019 bringing Bitcoin liquidity in.

- **2020:** DeFi Summer—yield farming and liquidity mining boom. TVL in DeFi jumps massively. Governance tokens proliferate, giving communities control (Compound’s COMP, Uniswap’s UNI in Sept 2020).

- **2021:** DeFi hits mainstream awareness as crypto markets boom; TVL crosses $100B across platforms at peak; however, high Ethereum fees also become an issue, paving way for Layer-2 solutions or other chains.

Knowing this history helps appreciate the present landscape, which we’ll describe next.
